Description: 
We show a case of NeRF reconstruction with limited camera viewpoints in a narrow view range, such as in a hemisphere. 
From the NeRF reconstructed mesh, these unseen outside background regions are empty, and the unseen occluded regions caused by object occlusion such as inside the box are incorrectly predicted. 
After rendering novel views, these regions are also incorrectly predicted. While most current methods are inherently designed to estimate uncertainty for the areas of the scene that can be observed in the training images, our approach is the first one that can not only quantify the uncertainty on the learned geometry and appearance, but also allocate high uncertainties on unseen regions, including outside and occluded points.
Additionally, we show a case of the Next-Best-View (NBV) application.
